# Get Started with HomeCloud

This guide walks you through installing HomeCloud, setting up your account, and connecting your devices.

## Install

### Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)

1. Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/asrient/HomeCloud/releases/latest/).
2. Download the installer for your platform:
   - **macOS** — `.dmg` file (available for Intel and Apple Silicon)
   - **Windows** — `.exe` installer
   - **Linux** — `.deb` package
3. Open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Mobile (Android, iOS)

Coming soon to Google Play and the App Store.

## Create Your Account

HomeCloud requires an account for secure device linking and pairing. It's easy to create your account with just your email, and in case you're worried, we don't like getting spam mails and we will never spam your inbox either.

You can skip login if you want, but an account is needed for device pairing.

## Add More Devices

To connect another device, simply install HomeCloud and **sign in with the same email**. The new device will automatically appear under "My Devices" on all your devices.

## Staying Connected

### On the Same Network (Home/Office WiFi)

When your devices are on the same WiFi network, they find each other **automatically** using local network discovery. No internet connection is needed — everything happens directly between your devices over your local network.

On iOS, you may see a prompt asking to allow HomeCloud to find devices on your local network, tap **Allow**.

### On Different Networks (Remote)

When your devices are on different networks (for example, your phone on mobile data and your laptop at home), HomeCloud connects them directly over the internet using peer-to-peer networking. Your actual data always travels **directly between your devices** and never passes through or stored on any server.

Remote connections happen automatically in the background. As long as both devices are online and signed into the same account.

## What You Can Do Next

Once your devices are connected, you can:

- **Browse files** on any connected device — open, download, or transfer them
- **View photos** from any device's photo library or camera roll
- **Control media playback** — play, pause, skip, and adjust volume on your desktop from your phone
- **Share your clipboard** — copy on one device, paste on another
- **Send files and links** — instantly share content between devices with no size limits

## FAQ

**Devices not finding each other on the same WiFi?**
- Make sure both devices are on the same network.
- On iOS, check that local network permission is granted (Settings → HomeCloud → Local Network).
- On Android, ensure WiFi multicast is not blocked by your router.
- Try restarting the app on both devices.

**OTP email not arriving?**
- Check your spam/junk folder.
- Make sure you entered the correct email address.
- Wait a minute and try again — there may be a short delay.

**Is it safe to use HomeCloud on public WiFi (coffee shops, hotels, airports)?**

Yes. All communication between your devices is end-to-end encrypted. This means even if someone on the same network intercepts the traffic, they cannot read your data. The encryption keys never leave your device and are not shared with our servers or anyone else. HomeCloud is designed to be safe on any network.
