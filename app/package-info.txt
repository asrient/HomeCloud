Notes on package.json
------------------------------
"build" property is used by yackage during desktop builds.
The package.json file is updated automatically at build time to make the following changes:
- Remove serverOnly dependencies for desktop build and vice-versa.
- Remove devDependencies.
- Add "main" property to the file based on the build type, eg: "dist/desktop/index.js" for desktop.
- Use "desktopUnpackDirs" and "desktopUnpackModules" properties to generate "build.unpackDir" property which accepts a string.
- Any dependencies mentioned in "desktopUnpackModules" will be traversed recursively and all it's dependencies will be added to the list as well.
- It seems if you decide to unpack a module with furthur dependencies, those dependencies should be unpacked too, else the module is not able to find them.

Explaination of unpacked modules and directories:
- "asset": custom asset directory.

Sharp
- "node_modules/@img": was added manually here since it would make the string very big (many deps mentioned as @img/<dep>).
- "node_modules/detect-libc": no furthur deps.
- "node_modules/semver": no furthur deps.
- "node_modules/sharp": if not unpacked, gave errors related to readFile.
- "color" module: has a few dependencies.

Sequalize
- "node_modules/validator": error 'readFile only works on file', possibly caused by a custom impl of require.

Open
- "open" module: dynamic import hack was not working after package.

Sqlite3
- "bindings" module: gave 'cannot read indexOf of undefined' error when packed.
