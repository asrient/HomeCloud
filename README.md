### The Next Gen Self Hosted Cloud

![Not One Piece, many pieces](img/op_1.jpg)

A distributed cloud service that runs on your own local (or remote) devices. It is a media center application that instead of having a single main server hosting it, stores your content accross multiple devices that you own so that you don't need a dedicated server machine for self-hosting anymore.
Keep your content wherever they are, on any device and access them from anywhere.
